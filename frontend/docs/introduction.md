title: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
---

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed to take you on a journey from the fundamental principles of robotics to the advanced concepts of artificial intelligence that bring humanoid robots to life.

## What You Will Learn

Throughout this book, you will explore a wide range of topics, structured into modules that build upon each other. Here’s a glimpse of what you'll learn:

- **Module 1: The Basics of ROS 2**
  - Get started with the Robot Operating System (ROS), the backbone of modern robotics development. You’ll learn about ROS nodes, topics, services, and actions, and how to build a basic robotics project.

- **Module 2: Simulating Robots**
  - Dive into the world of robotics simulation with Gazebo. You'll learn how to create and simulate robot models using URDF and SDF, and how to integrate sensors and physics for realistic simulations.

- **Module 3: Autonomous Navigation**
  - Explore the concepts of autonomous navigation using the ROS Navigation Stack (Nav2). You will learn about SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), path planning, and how to make a robot navigate its environment autonomously.

- **Module 4: Advanced AI in Robotics**
  - Delve into the advanced AI concepts that power intelligent robots. Topics include cognitive planning, voice-to-action systems, and reinforcement learning for robotics. You will also work on a capstone project to apply your skills.

By the end of this book, you will have a solid foundation in physical AI and humanoid robotics, with the practical skills to design, simulate, and program intelligent robotic systems.
