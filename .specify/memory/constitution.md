# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Comprehensive and Accurate Content
All content must be technically accurate, up-to-date, and cover the specified topics in depth. All generated content must be reviewed and verified by a subject matter expert before publication.

### II. Practical, Hands-On Learning
The textbook must prioritize practical application. Every chapter should include practical exercises, real-world examples, and interactive diagrams where applicable to reinforce learning.

### III. User-Centric Design and Personalization
The user interface and experience are paramount. The platform must be intuitive, visually appealing (matching the UI mockups provided in the `UI/` directory), and offer features for personalization (based on user background) and translation (initially to Urdu).

### IV. AI-Driven Content Augmentation
Leverage AI (e.g., context7) to enrich the textbook's content, ensuring it remains dynamic and engaging. AI-generated content must be clearly marked and adhere to the same accuracy standards as human-written content.

### V. Modular and Scalable Architecture
The Docusaurus-based platform must be built with a modular structure, initially consisting of 4 main modules, each containing 4-6 chapters. This architecture must facilitate easy updates, content additions, and future expansion.

### VI. Open and Accessible
The textbook will be publicly and freely accessible online. The content should be written to be understandable to a broad audience, and features like translation are intended to maximize this reach.

## Course Focus

The project's primary focus is on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," with specific emphasis on the following technologies and concepts:
- Embodied Intelligence
- ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Gazebo Simulation
- Unity Engine for Robotics
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

## Development Workflow

Development will follow a feature-driven approach. New content, features, or architectural changes will be developed in separate branches, reviewed via pull requests, and merged into the main branch only after passing all automated checks and manual reviews.

## Governance

This Constitution is the foundational document for the project. All development practices, content contributions, and architectural decisions must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, a review period, and majority approval from the core project maintainers.
