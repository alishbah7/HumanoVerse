Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans. As robots become more integrated into our daily lives, the importance of effective and safe HRI grows.

## Key Aspects of HRI

- **Communication:** How robots and humans communicate with each other, including verbal and non-verbal cues.
- **Collaboration:** How robots and humans can work together to achieve a common goal.
- **Social Interaction:** How robots can interact with humans in a socially acceptable and engaging manner.
- **Safety:** Ensuring that robots can operate safely around humans.

## Applications

HRI is crucial in a wide range of applications, including:

- **Healthcare:** Robots assisting patients and medical staff.
- **Manufacturing:** Collaborative robots (cobots) working alongside humans.
- **Education:** Robots as teaching assistants and learning companions.
- **Personal Robotics:** Robots in the home providing assistance and companionship.
